            Hi! I am Bryan. I am a librarian at Nashville Public Library and a member of Library Freedom Project. Library Freedom Project is a nonprofit, the mission of which is to make real the promise of intellectual freedom in libraries. Not only in libraries, but in society, we are a crossroads about privacy rights. I want to talk about our current responsibilities, and some ways to think about the paths ahead. All the little green "i"s you see through this presentation are you. You're a person, you count. What you want your future to be? What do you want your
						 to be like?
                Interactive exercise:

					Threat models are a way to think about what information you need to protect and how you are going to protect it. If we are talking about people and data about them, we often use the term Personally Identifiable Information or PII. PII is info that can identify individual people. It can do this by itself or in combinations with other info. When you think about what you collect, or who you share it with, think about PII which is sensitive information. Protecting it is important! But back to threat models. There are some questions you can ask to help clarify your threat model.
							1) What do you want to protect?
							2) Who do you want to protect if from?
							3) How likely is it that you will need to protect it?
							4) How bad are the consequences if you fail?
							5) Houw much trouble are you willing to go through to prevent the consequences?
						Exercise 2:
							"Let's answer these questions for ourselves... "
						Exercise 3
							Break into groups and think about sample patron threat models

						Thanks to EU's GDPR (General  Data Protection Regulation) we know that Spotify collects every click, what headphones you use, window size, what files you dropped and dropped. It is not a music playing machine. It is a recording machine. This is the desktop app. If we consider the same data collection on via phone app, it also knows where you are at the times, when you sleep, if your moving fast and slow, etc. Your phone is literally an extention of yourself and we are all, no joke, cyborgs. That is a different talk. It should be noted that Ratuken, the company that owns Overdrive, is the Amazon of Japan. They are using libraries as as a data source about American consumers.

						Facebook is always watching you. Even when you are not on Facebook. Non-PII data from coookies  can be reverse engineered via the mosaic effect. Academic studies have shown this for years. If this wasn't the case, Facebook would have no reason to track you when you don't use their site. The Yale Privacy Lab found that many popular apps on Android, like Weather Channel, Lyft, and Tinder (to name a few) are loaded with third-party trackers. Privacy International found that 61% of apps they tested sent data to Facebook whether you had a Facebook account or not. We know this because Android is open source. It would be illegal to do this kind of study on iOS because of DRM.

She does not deserve annoying ads, malware, identity theft, fake news, or a loan with really bad terms. My mother has a human right to not be surveilled. You love and respect your patrons, and your communities. Patrons trust us. If we don't protect patrons privacy, we violate that trust.  We have a professional and ethical obligation to mitigate risk to our patrons. When someone says privacy is dead ask them for their password. Now some privacy nihilists are going to say, "The ship has sailed. It's over. Everything is collected." I agree that current state is bad, but does that mean we stop fighting for what is better. This issue is bigger than libraries. If we are heading towards climate disaster does that mean we just shrug our shoulders? A handful of famous men of have fired for sex crimes, does mean we've solved the problem of sexual harassment? Grand juries almost never recommend charges again police officers, does that mean we are going to stop fight for justice in our communities? Of course not, we're librarians. We are not complicit. We resist. Also, because we are librarians, here are some references.
